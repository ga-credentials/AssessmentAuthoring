# GA Credentials - FE2 Code Challenge Authoring

You've been commissioned to create 3 Javascript Code Challenges for GA Credentials. There are 3 deliverables:

- **Deliverable 1.** Brainstorm / Proposal.
- **Deliverable 2.** Code Challenge Prompts.
- **Deliverable 3.** Starter and Solution Code.

We've provided for you assets to help with this process, and a detailed step-by-step guide below.

Here is an exmaple of a very successful past set of Code Challenges, and the level of rigor we expect in code: (*TBD*).

## Deliverable 1: Proposal

### Step 1: Receive materials from GA

Github Repo with:

- Codebase
- Prompt Template

### Step 2: Brainstorm Code Challenge Ideas

Some examples of JS Code Challenges:

- Lazy load articles from an API
- Add a twitter feed
- Add Weather to a Page
- Parse JSON Data
- Handle AJAX Errors
- Add Drag-and-Drop functionality to an order form
- Perform form validation
- Filter and organize content by tags
- Create a Modal Pop-up
- Program a collapsible mobile nav
- Implement Smooth Scroll

Brainstorm a few challenges you could add to the codebase and share this with your GA contact.

### Step 4: GA Reviews, Provides Feedback

GA will review your submission and suggest a particular 

## Deliverable 2: Code Challenge Prompts

### Step 1: Build All the Things!

### Step 2: Generate Animated GIFs of Behavior:

Resulting GIF should be 600px wide. Ensure it is as optimized as possible.

### Step 3: Write Prompts

Your prompts should outline the functional specs and follow the template included in this repo: 

https://github.com/ga-credentials/AssessmentAuthoring/blob/fe2/FE2-README.txt

Plug the GIFs you made in Step 2 in their appropriate places in the README.

Replace README.md with this new, completed prompt. Send a link to your repo to your your GA contact.

### Step 4: GA Reviews, Provides Feedback

GA will review your submission and get back to you with any necessary edits.

## Deliverable 3: Starter and Solution Code

### Step 1: Branch

Once you have the the code working and the prompt created, create two branches on your repo. One will be for the starting state of the code for Assessment takers. The other will be an exemplar solution. Master should remain the working branch.

- `master` (Working Branch, including README.md)
- `codebase` (Initial State)
- `solution` (Exemplar Solution)

`codebase` and `solution` should not contain gifs, readme files, anything the test-taker would not see.

Send a link to your repo to your GA contact.

### Step 2: GA Reviews, Provides Feedback

GA will review your submission and get back to you with any necessary edits.
