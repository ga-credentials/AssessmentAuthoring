Do the following: 

- Create company identity (Colors, Typography, Imagery)

Please adhere as closely as you can to Google's Style Guides for [HTML & CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml) / [JS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml)

Your website should be a fully-realized, potentially multiple page. You are welcome to add JS functionality, but a static website is sufficient.
