# GA Credentials - Codebase Authoring

You've been commissioned to create a codebase for GA Credentials. This task is broken into two deliverables, with the ultimate goal a fully-realized, static website. 

- **Deliverable 1.** Brainstorm / Proposal. 
- **Deliverable 2.** Codebase Creation.

We've provided for you assets to help with this process, and a detailed step-by-step below.

Here is an exmaple of a very successful past codebase, and the level of rigor we expect in code and Design:
______ (link to Explorer).

## Deliverable 1. Brainstorm / Proposal. 

### Step 1: Fork this repository

### Step 2: Choose a Company Archetype
* Ecommerce (e.g. https://www.everlane.com/)
* Creative Artist Portfolio (https://jeremiebattaglia.com/en/)
* Digital Agency (e.g. http://etchapps.com/)
* Social Media (e.g. https://vine.co/)
* Web-based Publication (e.g. https://medium.com/) 
* Print-based Publication (e.g. http://www.newyorker.com/)
* Museum / Landmark (e.g. https://www.si.edu/)
* Blog / Online Journal (e.g. http://dcurt.is/)
* Restaurant (e.g. http://www.fifteen.net/)
* Event / Film Landing Page (e.g. http://vivaco.com/demo/ventcamp/)
* Video / Syndication (e.g. https://www.ted.com/)
* Personal Banking (e.g. https://www.tdbank.com)

### Step 3: Choose a Layout Archetype

| Big Hero | Fixed Sidebar | Portfolio | 
| -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| ![Big Hero](layouts/big-hero.png) | ![Fixed Sidebar](layouts/fixed-sidebar.png) | ![Portfolio](layouts/portfolio.png) |
| Can be found in `/big-hero` | Can be found in `/fixed-sidebar` | Can be found in `/portfolio` | 

### Step 4: Create a Fake Company

Email GA with a short, 1 paragraph proposal, specifying:

- the Company Name 
- the Company Archetype
- the Layout Archetype
- what Pages / Features the website will have
- a short narrative about the company

For instance: 

- "Next Level"
- Digital Agency
- Fixed Sidebar
- Home, About Us, Blog, Careers, Take it to the Next Level
- Contact form on "Take it to Next Level" page
- "The Next Level is a digital Agency providing Web and Mobile Application solutions for a variety of clients."

### Step 5: GA Reviews, Provides Feedback

GA will review your submission and get back to you with any necessary edits.

## Deliverable 2. Codebase Creation.

### Step 1: Organize your Repository

Rename your forked repository to the new company name. Copy the files from your selected layout archetype into the main directory of your repo. Delete unnecessary files. You should have:

- css
- images
- index.html
- js
- README.md

### Step 2: Build the thing!

Do the following:

- Create company identity (Colors, Typography, Imagery)
- Add content (ipsum is fine - http://meettheipsums.com/)
- Edit, add additional HTML (as necessary)
- Edit, add additional CSS (as necessary)

Please adhere as closely as you can to Google's Style Guides for [HTML & CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml) / [JS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml)

Your website should be a fully-realized, potentially multiple page. You are welcome to add JS functionality, but a static website is sufficient.

Here is an exemplar submission: _____.

### Step 3: Deliver

Email GA with a link to your repo and a list of suggested features you envision on the site (i.e. potential code challenges)

### Step 4: GA Reviews, Provides Feedback

GA will review your submission and get back to you with any necessary edits.
